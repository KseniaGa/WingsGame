#Add a polunytsa joke

#ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Midday

#Poludnitsa is a noon demon in Slavic mythology. She can be referred to in English as "Lady Midday", "Noonwraith" or "Noon Witch". 
#She was usually pictured as a young woman dressed in white that roamed field bounds.[3] She assailed folk working at noon, 
#causing heatstrokes and aches in the neck; sometimes she even caused madness.

#Poludnitsa, who makes herself evident in the middle of hot summer days, takes the form of whirling dust clouds
# and carries a scythe, sickle or shears; most likely the shears would be of an older style, not akin to modern scissors. 
#She will stop people in the field to ask them difficult questions or engage them in conversation. If anyone fails to answer 
#a question or tries to change the subject, she will cut off their head or strike them with illness. She may appear as an old hag,
# a beautiful woman, or a 12-year-old girl, and she was useful in scaring children away from valuable crops. 
#She is only seen on the hottest part of the day and is a personification of a sun-stroke.[5]

#Poludnitsa, according to beliefs, loves to dance. If she sees a girl lying down to rest in the field, she will wake her 
#up and begin to persuade her to dance. If the girl agrees, she will be forced to dance until the «evening dawn». 
#Poludnitsa cannot be beaten in dancing; however, if such a girl is found, the noon spirit will present her with a rich dowry.[8]

# Загальне заняття полудниць — карати тих, хто працюють у полі в полудень. Людям, яких вони зустрічали на полі,
# загадували загадки, які неможливо відгадати[2], і за відповідями вирішували вбити чи скалічити своїх жертв. 
#Також душили женців, які спали в полі, викрадали дітей, які гралися на краю поля[4], покидали дім чи крали плоди. 
#Часом били по ногах тих, хто їм не вклоняється[2][3]. В Україні, на Житомирщині, вірили, що полудниця змушує людину
# блукати по лісу в полудень[6].

#Лужичани, проте, наділяли полудницю і корисними функціями. Вони вважали, що полудниця крім того охороняє поле від злодіїв[2],
# косить поле замість людей[8]; вірили, що хто насміхатиметься з потворної полудниці, тому вона нашле виразки, але хто її 
#похвалить або щось подарує — отримає від полудниці нескінченний клубок пряжі[9]. Як охоронниця полів, вона могла випробовувати
#женців, розпитуючи їх як ростити збіжжя, та карала тих, хто не давали правильної відповіді[10].
